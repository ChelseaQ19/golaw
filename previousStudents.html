          <br>

           The 2nd year student on the LLB Bachelor of Laws at WIT has also gone on to re-establish the WIT Law Society.
          <br>
		  <br>
           Emily, who is a past pupil of St Mary’s Secondary School, New Ross, Co. Wexford explains why she chose to do the Try event:
          <br>
		  <br>
           <strong>“I decided to attend the Try Law Event at WIT in 6th year as I was unsure what I wanted to study after the Leaving Certificate. I had a passion for English and knew that whatever career I chose, that I wanted to make a difference in the world. Therefore, law seemed like a great fit for me.”</strong></p>

 		    Orla explains why she chose to do the Try event: <strong>“I was at a loss for what I wanted to do in college and was constantly changing my CAO when I saw that WIT was offering Try events. I decided to go to the Try Law event in December of 2019 and from the beginning of the event I was immediately interested in a course I had never previously looked at. I had also been to another Try event with the science department of WIT and again it gave me a great taste of different college courses and really helped me in making my decision.</strong></p>

		   <p class="facilityTextPageOne">Emily says now that she is studying LLB Bachelor of Laws, she really enjoys the different electives that WIT offers as it allows students to tailor their law degree to fit their personal interests.She also loves the smaller class sizes at WIT, as students can ask their lecturers questions in class and gain a deep understanding of the topics being taught.Emily recalls how she came to re-establish the WIT Law Society as a second-year student."At the beginning of second year, I decided that I would join a few societies to try and make my college experience as memorable as possible; however, I realised quickly that there was no WIT Law Society running," she says."I decided that I would take it upon myself to re-establish the Law Society and create a fun and inclusive society for anyone who studies Law or has an interest in Law. The task of establishing a society from the ground up, and taking on the role of its chairperson, has been a rewarding task that helps me take a break from studying and make new friends.</p>

		   <p class="facilityTextPageTwo">Orla says now that she is studying LLB Laws, she really enjoys it: “I’ve loved most of the content in the course, granted it involves a lot of hard work! First year was strange being online but the lecturers made such an effort to make the modules interesting, I specifically enjoyed Tort Law and Commercial Law and now in second year it seems to be Criminal Law that I am finding to be one of my favourites followed closely by Labour Law. One of the main things that I love, regardless of the module, is that no matter what you always seem to learn something new in every lecture.” This is Orla's experience so far and she would highly recommend the course overall to people who have a thirst for knowledge and to delve deeper into the laws of the world.</p>
